* Complete this lab



## Outline / Notes

*  I've included a project which has a Trex class written along with some enums.
* I've wrote some tests for this class & the enum as well.
* I think it's a good idea to expand on this some more, maybe add another dinosaur with different functionality? Or we can leave it as is and expand on the Trex further. I leave that up to you! But tests should be written in a similar fashion for any added functionality.
